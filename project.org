* Display
** Existing LCD Module
Microtivity 16x2 black-on-green LCD
Breakout Board: ~80.5mm x 36mm
Module Hosing: ~71mm x 24mm
Display: ~65mm x 15mm

I declare this as not enough characters.

** DFRobot KeyPad Hat
The product page (https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1885.html) says that there are two versions:
- RGB Backlight (still available)
- RGB Font (discontinued)

I think that I have the "font" variation. Which I would prefer.
From the product photos (only /so/ detailed) the boards look identical. I'd bet it's just the LCD module that changed between them. The product page seems to cover both anyway.

I was mad at this thing for a long time, and I'm not sure why.
I had the impression that their examples were all just, here, run this little program that we wrote for you.
Which, I guess, is true - perhaps I didn't realize that the code was all totally readable.
I think I ran the C++ examples, which (being C++) all take input from the command line. So, it was basically a little command-line app.

Last time I used it, I ran the Python examples, which, of course I could read all the code. (The C++ code was there to read as well, but Python is so much easier.)

It was pretty simple to change the examples to try out different things.
But they all started with ~import rgb1602~ which made me mad, "all the magic is still hidden away in this RGB1602 class!!!"

I think that I thought that was referencing the C++ drivers for the device. But this morning ([2024-02-20 Tue 09:58]) I looked at the [[https://github.com/DFRobot/DFRobot_RGB1602_RaspberryPi][github repo]] and the rgb1602.py file is right there for the reading.

It's kind of big and fat, but its only external dependency is this ~smbus~ library, which is a pip install.
And [[https://github.com/kplindegaard/smbus2][here]] is this "drop-in replacement written in pure python" (https://github.com/kplindegaard/smbus2)


** Advisor Case
- LCD Window Dimensions: ~66mm x 21mm
  - diagonal: 69.26mm (2.727")

- Interior Display Housing: ~75mm x 30mm

** 20x4 Character LCD
Adafruit sells a 20x4 character LCD.
It _almost_ fits. The data sheet says the active display area is ~71mm x 21mm
Which overlaps the Advisor's LCD window.
However, the LCD has its own case, outline, module thing that might do fine.

* Raspberry Pi Pico
** Circuit Python
Serial console: /dev/tty.usbmodem111101
*** I2C

* DOING Get the python version of the screen control running

** A setback
Last time I hooked everything up to play, the thing wouldn't boot.
I was poking around and something near the Pi's micro SD card reader was so hot it just about burned me.
Googling around said that a defective card could heat up like that.
Sure enough, the blue 32GB card that I had in there has bent and cracked.

Later investigation leads me to believe that it might have happened when moving the Pi around in it's little red case.
So from now on, I need to be sure to remove the card before I move the board around in the case (opening, closing, removing the board...).

** DOING Download an OS image and write it to the card.
*** Another setback
I re-installed a new copy of Debian on Meade the X1 Carbon. I enabled fingerprint log-in and now the thing hangs when I try to log in. (Swiping my finger the first time didn't work, so I used my password.)

So I either need to fix that, re-re-install a Linux OS, or write the Rasberry Pi OS from macOS.

turns out, raspberrypi.com recommends an image-installer utility that runs perfectly well on Mac.

front-panel programmable pager with 8 CAPCODEs (they seem to call them "RIC" instead of "CAPCODE")
There is an Android app for sending pages, but not an iOS one. I should write the iOS one.

LCD Dimensions slightly larger than 80x36mm
